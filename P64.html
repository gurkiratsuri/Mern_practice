        <p><h3><b>Chapter 1</b></h3></p>
        <p>Molly had been staring out of her window for about an hour now. On her desk, lying between the copies of <i>Nature, New Scientist,</i> and all other scientific journals her work had appeared in, was a well thumbed copy of <i>On The Road.</i> It had been Molly's favorite boook since college, and the longer she spent in these four walls the more she felt she needed to be free.</p>
        <p>She had spent the last ten years in this room, sitting under a poster with an Oscar Wilde proclaiming that "Work is the refuge of people who have nothing better to do". Although many considered her pionerring work, unravelling the secrets of the llama DNA, to be an outstanding achievement, Molly <i>did</i> think she had something better to do.</p>
